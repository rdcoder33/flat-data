A man is standing next to a mailbox with a red flag. He is wearing glasses, a green hoodie, and dark pants with red shoes. He is holding a blue book in his left hand and is reaching into the mailbox with his right hand, pulling out various colorful envelopes and letters. Some letters are shown flying around the mailbox. There is grass at the base of the mailbox post.
