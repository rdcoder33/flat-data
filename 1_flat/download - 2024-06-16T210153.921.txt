A person is sitting on the floor next to an open suitcase. They are holding a hat in one hand and a rolled-up piece of clothing in the other. The suitcase contains clothes, a passport, and travel-sized toiletries. Behind the person, there is a poster on the wall that says "BEST VACATION PLACE" with an image of a beach and palm trees.
