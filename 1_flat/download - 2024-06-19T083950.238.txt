A man is standing next to a stove with rocks on top, possibly in a sauna setting. He is wearing a towel wrapped around his body and a hat. One hand is on his hip while the other is holding the towel at his shoulder. There are green leaves behind his head, which could be part of a traditional sauna accessory.
