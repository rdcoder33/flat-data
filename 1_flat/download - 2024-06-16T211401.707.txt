A delivery person is holding two cardboard boxes in one hand and pointing at a large map displayed on a screen with the other hand. The map shows a delivery route and a scooter icon with a location pin. There is a "Track Orders" section at the bottom of the screen. Next to the delivery person are two shopping bags placed on the ground.
