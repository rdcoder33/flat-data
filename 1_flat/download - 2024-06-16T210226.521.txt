An illustration featuring a person standing next to a large smartphone. The smartphone screen displays images of bats and a carved pumpkin, reminiscent of Halloween themes. The person, who appears to be a man, is leaning against the smartphone with one leg crossed over the other and one arm folded. There is also a smaller screen or picture frame nearby showing a bat, and a potted plant is placed at the bottom right corner.
