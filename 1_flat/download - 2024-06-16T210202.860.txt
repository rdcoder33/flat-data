A woman is standing next to an easel with a painting of a tree made from colorful handprints. She has paint on her hands and clothes, indicating she is actively participating in the painting process. There are three paint buckets on the ground near the easel. She is looking at the canvas with one hand raised, likely adding another handprint to the artwork.
