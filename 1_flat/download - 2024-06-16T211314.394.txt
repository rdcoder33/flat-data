A person wearing a cap and uniform is holding two yellow boxes. They are standing in front of a large smartphone screen that displays a map with a location pin and a 5-star rating. The screen also shows text that says "RELOCATION SERVICES." In the foreground, there are household items, including a washing machine and a television, suggesting a moving or relocation service.
