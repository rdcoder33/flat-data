Three children are participating in a traditional game where they attempt to eat snacks hanging from strings. The child in the middle, wearing a white "Indonesia" t-shirt, is looking up at the snack. The other two children, wearing red shirts with a yellow emblem, are standing on either side, also looking up at the snacks. The background includes trees and faint silhouettes of people.
