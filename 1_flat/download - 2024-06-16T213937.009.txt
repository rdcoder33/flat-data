The image is an illustration of a man with a long beard and hair tied in a bun, sitting cross-legged under a tree. He is wearing traditional orange and yellow robes and has several beads around his neck and arms. The man appears to be meditating, with his eyes closed and hands resting on his knees. The tree behind him has a thick trunk and lush green foliage.
