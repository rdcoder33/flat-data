A man and a woman are standing next to a decorated Christmas tree. Both are wearing festive clothing and Santa hats. The woman is holding a book, possibly a carol book, while the man has his arm around her shoulder. There are musical notes above their heads, indicating they are singing. A small table with a "Merry Christmas" card and a gift box is visible to the right of the tree.
