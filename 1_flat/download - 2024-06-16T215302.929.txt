A cartoon illustration depicts a man holding a net, seemingly trying to catch bugs. Next to him is a large computer screen with code and bugs on it, symbolizing software bugs. Above the screen, there is a yellow sign with the word "ERROR" and a red exclamation mark in a speech bubble, indicating an error or issue in the code. A gear icon is also present, representing settings or development.
