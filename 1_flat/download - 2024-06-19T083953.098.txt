Two people, one in a red sweater with Christmas tree patterns and the other in a green sweater, are sharing a moment under a large green wreath decorated with holly leaves. The person in the red sweater is wearing a red hat with a white pom-pom, while the person in the green sweater has a green hat. They appear to be leaning in close to each other.
