A man and a woman are depicted carrying boxes. The man is bent over, carrying a large yellow box on his back, while the woman is holding a smaller yellow box labeled "Book & Stationery" in her hands. They appear to be in the process of moving items, with additional boxes and a mirror visible in the background. The setting suggests an indoor environment, possibly a home.
