A man, woman, and two children are standing together. The man is holding an umbrella that covers the entire family, symbolizing protection. The woman is holding a baby, while the older child stands next to the man, touching the umbrella. There is a large shield with a medical cross on it in front of the older child, and a large clipboard with checkmarks in the background. Green leaves are placed at the bottom
