A man is standing next to a small rocket, holding a wrench in one hand and lifting the rocket's nose cone with the other. He appears to be performing maintenance or assembly work on the rocket. Beside him, there is an orange toolbox on the ground, and behind the rocket, a metal structure is visible, possibly part of a launch platform or support frame.
