This is an illustration of a man with a beard, wearing an orange turban and a light blue shirt. He is sitting cross-legged and holding a piece of flatbread in his right hand. In front of him is a tray with various dishes, including what appears to be a cup and small bowls with different types of food. The man is smiling and seems to be enjoying his meal.
