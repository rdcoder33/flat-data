An illustration of a person with short hair, wearing a red shirt, standing behind a balance scale. On one side of the scale is a clock, representing time, and on the other side is a coin with a dollar sign, representing money. The person has their hands raised, as if weighing the two options. Dollar signs are floating in the background.
