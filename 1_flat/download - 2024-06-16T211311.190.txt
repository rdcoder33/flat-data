An illustration of Santa Claus holding two wrapped gifts in his hands. He is smiling and has a white beard and red outfit. Behind him, a reindeer with antlers is peeking out, holding a yellow bell. In the background, there is a decorated Christmas tree with a star on top. The text "Ho-Ho-Hoo" is written next to Santa.
