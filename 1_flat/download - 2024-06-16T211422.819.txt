Two boys are standing on a finish line. The boy on the left is wearing a red shirt and dark shorts, with his left arm bent and his right arm by his side. The boy on the right is wearing a white shirt with "INDONESIA" written on it and dark shorts, with both arms slightly extended. They are outdoors, with a tree and some bushes in the background, and a string of triangular flags
