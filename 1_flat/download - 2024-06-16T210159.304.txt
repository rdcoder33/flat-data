A man with a beard is wearing a red apron and holding a potted plant in his left hand while using a small brush in his right hand. He is surrounded by various potted plants placed on a shelf and a table. A watering can is also on the table next to the plants. There is a heart symbol above the plant he is holding, indicating his affection for it.
