A woman is shopping for dresses. She is holding a yellow shopping bag in her left hand and touching a purple dress on a rack with her right hand. The rack has dresses in red, blue, green, yellow, and purple colors. There are also several boxes stacked on the floor next to the rack. A speech bubble with a red heart indicates that she likes the dress she is touching.
