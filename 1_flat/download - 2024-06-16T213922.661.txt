This is an illustration of a man wearing traditional attire. He is shirtless, adorned with gold jewelry, including a necklace, armbands, and a headpiece. He is dressed in purple pants with a red cloth tied around his waist, secured by a gold belt. The man is smiling and has one arm raised with his index finger pointing upwards, while the other arm is bent with a clenched fist.
