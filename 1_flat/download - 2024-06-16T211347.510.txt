A woman and a man are communicating using a string telephone. The woman, on the left, is wearing a yellow top and a dark skirt, holding the can to her ear. The man, on the right, is wearing a blue shirt and dark pants, holding the can to his mouth. They are standing on either side of a brick wall, with a small potted plant in the foreground.
