A woman is standing next to a large smartphone displaying a stock trading interface. The screen shows a candlestick chart with green and orange bars, indicating market movements. There are buttons labeled "BUY" and "SELL" on the screen. The woman is pointing at the chart with one hand while holding a tablet in the other. Several coins with dollar signs are floating around the scene.
