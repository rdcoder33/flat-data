The image shows two individuals in front of a house. On the left, a woman is holding a large bag with a dollar sign on it and is pointing towards a "SOLD!" sign on the house. On the right, a man is holding a set of keys and some documents, with a briefcase by his side. The house in the background appears to have been sold.
