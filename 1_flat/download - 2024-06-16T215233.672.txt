The illustration shows a person, possibly a man, wearing a pink shirt. He is holding a folder that contains documents. On one of the documents, there is a bar graph with different colored bars. Above the folder, there are three icons: a green triangle, a pink circle with a person symbol, and a green and blue pie chart. The person appears to be examining the contents of the folder.
