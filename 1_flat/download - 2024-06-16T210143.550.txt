The image is an illustration of a male doctor wearing a mask and a blue coat, holding a yellow clipboard in one hand. He is standing in front of a large calendar and a clock showing 5:00 pm. There are medical symbols such as a shield with a cross, a first aid kit, and a medicine bottle in the foreground. The doctor appears to be pointing at a notification icon on the calendar.
