Two people, one appearing to be a man and the other possibly a woman, are sitting at a table. Each person has a laptop in front of them. They are engaged in a conversation, as indicated by the speech bubbles above their heads. The man on the left is gesturing with his hand, while the woman on the right is also gesturing with her hand. Both are seated on chairs facing each other.
