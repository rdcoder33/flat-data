It shows three boxes, two of which are stacked on the left and one larger box on the right placed on a pallet with an open lid containing another box. Above the boxes is a large umbrella with blue and white stripes, symbolizing protection or coverage. The boxes have upward arrows indicating their orientation. The background is black, making the elements stand out clearly.
