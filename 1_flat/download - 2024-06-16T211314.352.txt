A woman with long dark hair is sitting on the floor surrounded by several cardboard boxes labeled "FRAGILE." She is holding a yellow box and using tape to seal it. There is a lamp, a mirror, and a calendar among the items in the boxes. The scene appears to be indoors with a window in the background.
