A man and two children are depicted in a celebratory scene. The man is sitting on the floor, holding an envelope and smiling, while the boy and girl stand beside him, each holding envelopes as well. The background features a night sky with a crescent moon and stars, and two hanging lanterns. There are also small potted plants on either side of the group.
