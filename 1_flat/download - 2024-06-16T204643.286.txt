The image is an illustration of two people, a man and a woman, shaking hands. The man is on the right and is wearing a blue shirt with circular patterns, while the woman is on the left wearing a red shirt with wavy lines. Above them is a star, and there are speech bubbles with ellipses next to each person, suggesting they are communicating. A large pencil is depicted below their hands.
