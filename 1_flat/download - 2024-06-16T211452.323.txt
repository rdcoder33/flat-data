The image depicts three figures in traditional orange robes, seated in a meditative posture on a platform. The central figure is in a lotus position with hands resting on the lap, while the two figures on either side have their hands in a prayer position. There are three lit candles in front of them, and a large yellow circle in the background with clouds and stars, suggesting a serene, spiritual setting.
