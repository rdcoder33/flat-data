The image depicts a conceptual illustration of online education. A large smartphone is shown with a computer monitor on its surface displaying a video player interface. In front of the monitor, there are several chairs arranged as if in a classroom setting. A speech bubble-like shape to the right of the chairs contains the text "ONLINE EDUCATION." The illustration uses a minimalist design with blue and white colors.
