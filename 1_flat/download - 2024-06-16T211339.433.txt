A woman is standing next to a large book that is open. She is pointing to a green chalkboard with the text "WELCOME TO CLASSROOM." She is holding a folder or book in her other hand. The book has pages with text and illustrations visible, and there are classroom items like chalk and an eraser on the ledge of the chalkboard.
