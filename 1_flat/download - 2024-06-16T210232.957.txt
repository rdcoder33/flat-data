The image features three colorful gnomes standing in the snow. Each gnome has a distinct, vibrant hat adorned with different patterns: the left gnome has a hat with orange and yellow stripes, the middle gnome has a blue hat with white polka dots, and the right gnome has a pink and green striped hat. Snow is falling around them, and there is snow accumulated on their hats and beards.
