Three people are celebrating a victory. A man in a suit and tie is holding one end of a large green banner that reads "CHAMPIONS." A woman in a blue shirt and black pants is jumping in the air, holding a golden trophy. Another woman in a blue shirt and black skirt is holding the other end of the banner. Confetti and coins are scattered around them.
