The image depicts two figures. The figure on the left is adorned with a golden headdress, a peacock feather, and a garland of flowers, holding a piece of cloth. The figure on the right is a woman with long dark hair, dressed in yellow garments, with her hands joined in a gesture of reverence or prayer, and tears streaming down her face.
