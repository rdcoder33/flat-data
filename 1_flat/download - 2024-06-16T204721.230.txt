A person wearing a chef's hat and uniform is standing in a kitchen. They are holding a spatula in one hand and gesturing with the other. Behind them, there are three pans hanging on the wall, a pot on the counter, and two containers, possibly for spices, on the countertop. The person is standing in front of a stove with an oven.
