An illustrated man is standing in a forested area holding an axe over his shoulder. He appears confused, as indicated by the question marks above his head. He is wearing a green shirt, black pants, green boots, and yellow gloves. There are trees and tree stumps around him, and a sign next to him reads "STOP DEFORESTATION."
