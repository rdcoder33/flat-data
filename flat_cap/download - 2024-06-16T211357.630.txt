A person wearing a hoodie is depicted holding a fishing rod, metaphorically "fishing" for passwords on a computer screen. The screen shows a password entry field and various security icons. A warning shield with an exclamation mark is displayed, indicating a security alert. The person also holds documents and a folder, suggesting an attempt to obtain sensitive information. A small plant is placed on the ground in front of the person.
