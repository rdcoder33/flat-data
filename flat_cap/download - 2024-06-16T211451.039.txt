A man wearing a hard hat and safety vest is standing on a platform, working on a yellow rocket. He is holding a gear in one hand and a wrench in the other, appearing to be in the process of fixing or assembling the rocket. There is a toolbox with various tools on the ground nearby. The rocket is mounted on a scaffold-like structure.
