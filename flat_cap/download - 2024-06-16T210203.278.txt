A person with short dark hair, wearing a yellow shirt and blue pants, is sitting on the floor and pinning something on a bulletin board. The bulletin board has various sections labeled "NEWS," "UPDATES," and "DID YOU KNOW?" There are also some pencils in a cup and a pair of scissors on the floor next to the person.
