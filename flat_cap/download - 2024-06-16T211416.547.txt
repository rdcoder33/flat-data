A man and a young girl are playing with a paper airplane in a living room. The man is standing with one arm raised, holding the paper airplane, while the girl is reaching out towards him. They are both smiling and appear to be having fun. A woman is sitting on the couch with a hand on her face, watching them. The room is decorated with plants, a bookshelf, and a floor lamp.
