Two men are depicted in an outdoor setting with mountains and trees in the background. One man, wearing a yellow shirt and dark shorts, extends his hand in greeting. The other man, dressed in a green shirt and dark pants, carries a blue and red backpack and is also extending his hand, suggesting they are meeting or greeting each other. Both men are smiling and appear to be happy.
