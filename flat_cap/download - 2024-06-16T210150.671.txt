A man is standing on a ladder, reaching out to select a book from a large digital screen labeled "ONLINE LIBRARY." The screen displays shelves filled with various books. There is a search bar on the screen, and a few books are scattered on the floor and on a nearby table. The scene is well-lit with hanging lamps, and a potted plant is placed on the table.
