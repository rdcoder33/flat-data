A person is standing, holding a paint can in one hand and a paintbrush in the other. The individual is wearing a blue shirt and dark pants, both of which have paint splatters. Nearby, there is a trash bin filled with used paint cans and a few more paint containers on the ground. A painting is partially visible on the wall behind them.
