The image shows a man and a woman standing side by side, both with their hands clasped together in a prayer gesture. The woman is wearing a headscarf and a long-sleeved garment, while the man is dressed in a long-sleeved shirt and pants. They are positioned in front of an archway with a mosque silhouette in the background, accompanied by hanging lanterns on either side.
