Two people are engaged in painting. The person on the left is holding a paintbrush and a bucket of paint, while the person on the right is holding another paint bucket and gesturing with a speech bubble that says "MIX COLOR." They are both wearing blue shirts and dark pants, and there is a paint bucket on the ground between them. In the background, there are abstract paintings with yellow and orange colors.
