A person is standing in front of a large digital screen displaying an "ONLINE QURBAN" service. The screen shows images and information about different animals available for Qurban, such as a cow and a goat. The person appears to be interacting with the screen, possibly making a selection. Next to the person, there is a sheep standing on the ground. The "BUY NOW" button is visible on the screen.
