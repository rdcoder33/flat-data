A woman and a man are celebrating together. The man is holding a large trophy and appears to be excited. The woman is gesturing with her hands, possibly congratulating him. In the background, there is a table with a yellow chair, a clock on the wall, and decorative bunting hanging above. A potted plant is placed on the floor to the left side of the image.
