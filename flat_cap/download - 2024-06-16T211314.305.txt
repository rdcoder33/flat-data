The illustration shows a barbershop with a "CLOSED" sign on the door. A man wearing a face mask and a barber apron stands outside the shop, pointing at the closed sign. He is holding a pair of scissors in one hand. The background includes stylized virus icons, indicating a possible closure due to health concerns. There are also trees and a trash bin near the entrance of the barbershop.
