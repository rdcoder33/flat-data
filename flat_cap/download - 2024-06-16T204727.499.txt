A woman is conducting an online lesson or meeting, holding a clipboard and gesturing with a pen. On the other side of the screen, a man is sitting in a chair with a laptop on his lap, holding a pencil and looking at a diagram of a right triangle with the equation A=B+C. There is a light bulb above his head, indicating he has an idea. A potted plant is placed nearby.
