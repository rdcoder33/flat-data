A person wearing a green shirt and black pants is kneeling down to place trash into one of several large green garbage bags. The bags have a recycling symbol on them. The person is surrounded by scattered papers and litter. Behind them, there is a triangular sign that reads "DO NOT LITTER." Leaves and pieces of paper are floating in the air around the scene.
