Three gingerbread figures are depicted singing together. They are standing in the snow and holding a large sheet of music. Each figure is dressed in winter attire: the left figure wears a blue scarf and earmuffs, the middle figure wears a blue hat and red scarf, and the right figure wears a red hat and yellow scarf. Musical notes are illustrated around them, indicating they are singing.
