The illustration depicts a healthcare scenario where a woman, who is elderly and using a cane, stands next to a large container labeled "VACCINE." A man, presumably a healthcare worker, is holding a large syringe. Both individuals are wearing face masks. Surrounding them are cartoon representations of viruses with angry expressions. The background includes greenery, suggesting an outdoor setting.
