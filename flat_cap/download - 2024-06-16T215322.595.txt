This is an illustration of a man and a woman standing in front of a large, broken heart. The woman, wearing a red shirt, appears to be upset and has her hands on her hips. The man, wearing a yellow shirt, is reaching out to her with a concerned expression. There are speech bubbles above their heads, with the woman's bubble containing overlapping circles and the man's bubble containing an exclamation and question mark.
