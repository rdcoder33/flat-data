A person is depicted pushing against a bar in a descending bar chart. The individual is standing to the left of the tallest bar, with both hands placed on it, seemingly trying to prevent it from falling. The chart shows three bars of varying heights, decreasing from left to right, with an arrow indicating a downward trend.
