A woman and a man are exchanging gifts. The woman is holding a small red gift with a yellow ribbon, while the man is holding a larger blue gift with a white ribbon. They are standing in front of two windows with Christmas decorations, including a bell, ornaments, and a small white Christmas tree. The woman is wearing reindeer antlers on her head.
