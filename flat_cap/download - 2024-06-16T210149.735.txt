A boy is sitting and holding up a school timetable sheet in one hand while holding a pencil in the other. He is surrounded by various school supplies, including a backpack, a cup filled with writing utensils, and a stack of books. Behind him are sheets of paper representing a weekly schedule from Monday to Friday. A speech bubble next to him reads "SCHOOL TIMETABLE."
