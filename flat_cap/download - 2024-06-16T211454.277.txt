The illustration features a person riding a green scooter, wearing a green helmet and yellow jacket. The rider is presumably a delivery person, indicated by the blue box labeled "Delivery Service" on the back of the scooter. In the background, there is a large smartphone with a storefront awning at the top, suggesting an online delivery service. A map with a location pin is also visible on the screen of the smartphone.
