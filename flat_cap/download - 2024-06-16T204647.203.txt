Two individuals are sitting at a desk, engaged in a collaborative activity. One person is wearing a red shirt with a wavy pattern, while the other is wearing a blue shirt with a circular pattern. They are both looking at a laptop in front of them. Above them, there are icons representing a bar chart and a gear, indicating data analysis or a technical discussion. Speech bubbles suggest they are having a conversation.
