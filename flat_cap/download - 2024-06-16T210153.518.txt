A man and a woman are standing together, each with a blue suitcase. The man is holding a map and appears to be reading it, while the woman is looking at the map and has her hand on the man's shoulder. In the background, there are illustrations of famous landmarks such as the Statue of Liberty and the Eiffel Tower, along with a hot air balloon and an airplane, suggesting they are planning or dreaming about traveling.
