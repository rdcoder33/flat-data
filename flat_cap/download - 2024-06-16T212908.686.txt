An elderly man is standing outdoors in a snowy landscape. He is wearing a brown coat, blue gloves, a green hat, and blue pants. He is holding a cane in his left hand and feeding birds with his right hand, reaching towards a bird feeder hanging from a tree branch. A bird is seen flying near the feeder.
