The image depicts an illustration of an easel holding a canvas with a simple landscape image, showing a mountain and two birds. There is a paint palette with a brush dipped in blue paint in the foreground. Two cylindrical containers with blue liquid connected by wires are placed on either side of the easel. The background is black, making the elements stand out.
