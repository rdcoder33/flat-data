The image shows a tree with green foliage and roots extending into the soil. Below the surface, there are various pieces of litter, including a plastic bottle, a styrofoam container, and a plastic bag, all marked with red "X" symbols. A yellow warning sign with an exclamation mark is placed on the tree trunk, indicating a cautionary message about the presence of trash in the soil.
