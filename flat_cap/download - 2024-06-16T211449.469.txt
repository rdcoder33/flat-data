A person wearing a yellow headscarf and glasses is sitting cross-legged on the floor. They are holding a green woven container and appear to be filling it with white grains, possibly rice, from a large yellow bowl beside them. There is a window in the background showing a sunny day with a small plant on the windowsill.
