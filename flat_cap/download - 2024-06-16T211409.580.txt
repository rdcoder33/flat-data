The image depicts three individuals, each dressed in traditional attire, engaged in what appears to be a religious or spiritual activity. One person is seated cross-legged on a rock with hands in a prayer position. Another individual is standing with their back turned, also in a prayer position, facing a tall structure. The third person is standing and praying, facing the seated individual. The background includes silhouettes of other people and rocky formations.
