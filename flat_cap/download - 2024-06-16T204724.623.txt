Two people are sitting across from each other at a table, both using laptops. The person on the left, wearing a red shirt, is gesturing with their hand. The person on the right, wearing a yellow shirt, has their hands clasped together and a speech bubble above them. There is a presentation board in the background displaying a graph with an upward trend. Both individuals are seated on green chairs.
