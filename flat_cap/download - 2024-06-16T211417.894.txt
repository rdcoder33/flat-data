A man is standing outdoors in front of an easel, painting a landscape. He is holding a paintbrush in one hand and a palette in the other. The scene he is painting includes trees, a body of water, and some hills in the background. The sun is shining in the sky, and there are a few clouds and birds. There are paint cans and other painting supplies on the ground near him.
