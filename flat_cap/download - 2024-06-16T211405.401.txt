The illustration depicts a man and a woman standing opposite each other, both dressed in white with green accents. The woman is wearing a hijab and the man is wearing a traditional cap. They are facing each other with their hands raised, as if in a gesture of greeting or celebration. In the background, there are green landscapes and a drum on each side.
