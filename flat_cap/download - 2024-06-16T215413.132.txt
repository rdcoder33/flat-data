The image depicts an isometric illustration of a networked computer system. At the center is a large central server or mainframe connected to three smaller server units, each with a cooling fan visible on top. There is also a cylindrical device connected to the central server. Lines and nodes indicate the connections between the central server, the smaller servers, and the cylindrical device, suggesting data flow or communication pathways.
