Two people are depicted making donations. The person on the left, a man, is holding a large coin with a dollar sign, while the person on the right, another man, is holding a dollar bill. Both are placing their contributions into a donation box that already contains several coins and bills. Red heart symbols float above the donation box, indicating the charitable nature of their actions.
