A person is depicted sorting waste, holding a plastic bottle in one hand and organic waste in the other. They are wearing gloves and standing between two bins: one labeled "Organic" and the other "Non-Organic." The organic bin contains food scraps, while the non-organic bin contains bottles and bags. Icons related to recycling are visible in the background.
