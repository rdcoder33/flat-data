A person is sitting cross-legged, holding a notepad and writing with a pen. Various items such as to-do lists, a clock, an open book, and envelopes are scattered around them, suggesting they are planning or organizing tasks. A light bulb icon above their head indicates they might be having an idea or moment of inspiration.
