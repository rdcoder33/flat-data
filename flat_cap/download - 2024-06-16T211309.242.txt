An illustration of a woman with long dark hair wearing a blue shirt. She is holding a paper bag filled with items in one hand and raising her other hand with her palm facing forward, as if signaling to stop. The word "STOP" is written in a speech bubble near her raised hand, and the word "PLASTIC" is written inside a bag icon near her other hand. The background includes abstract shapes and leaves.
