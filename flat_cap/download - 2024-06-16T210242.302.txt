Two firefighters, dressed in orange uniforms and yellow helmets, are kneeling and using a hose to spray water at a fire. The fire is coming from a building, with flames visible through a window and on an exterior wall. Smoke is billowing from the building. A green fire hydrant is connected to the hose they are using.
